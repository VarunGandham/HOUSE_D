# HOUSE_D
Once you open Git bash in a Folder you would like to dedicate for the specific Architecture project you are currently working on, 

You need to 

git clone https://github.com/VarunGandham/HOUSE_D.git                                                     -Command 1

Enter this command. 

This will create a local copy of the repository on your system which you will be working on. 


Enter the folder that has been created after cloning the above repository. 
open Git Bash in here and minimize it, we shall come back to it later. 


Create the necessary files in this local repository and then:



- Go back to the git bash console opened previously

git add .                                                                                                 -Command 2

git commmit -m"   *INSERT THE COMMIT MESSAGE YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAG IT WITH*  "                            -Command 3

git push                                                                                                  -Command1 4
